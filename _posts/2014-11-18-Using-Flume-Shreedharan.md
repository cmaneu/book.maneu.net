See it on [Amazon][azn].

I've just read *Using Flume* by [Hari Shreedharan][author]. I'm spending quite a lot of time with Hadoop 
and ElasticSearch lately. While I'm in dev, everything is "easy". However, thinking about my system running
for about 30M users , and things get more complicated :).

I've picked-up this book because Flume came quite often in my researchs, and the author has created Flume ;)

## What's inside?

I'm writing this now :)

## Bottom line

If you want to manage a stream of data to go from one point to a big data system (Hadoop, ElasticSearch, ...),
Flume may be your best choice. If Flume is your choice, then, this book is your best first step in learning Flume.
